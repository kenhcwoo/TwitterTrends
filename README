This is just a simple program that makes a call to the Twitter API, grabs the top 10 trends and displays them to the command prompt. There is no fancy GUI or anything like that.

The API called is https://api.twitter.com/1/trends/1.json. I have hardcoded the value of 1 as the woeid.
The documentation is found here https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/trends/%3Awoeid.

The program also uses gson to parse the response.
